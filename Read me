# NOVA Adaptive Learning Optimization

## üß† Project Overview
NOVA is an adaptive learning and classification framework** designed to enhance optimization and decision-making using adaptive algorithms and object-oriented principles.  
This project includes code implementations, reference materials, and a conceptual audio explanation (POCQ) that outlines the core mechanics and rationale behind the NOVA algorithm.
